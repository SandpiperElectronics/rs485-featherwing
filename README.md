This featherwing PCB allows for long-distance communication between feather microcontrollers. This board implements an RS-485 network with bidirectional communication. RS-485 was selected over other twisted pair protocols due to it having no defined software protocol. 
This featherwing uses a Texas Instruments THVD1424RGTR RS-485 Driver. The THVD1424RGTR driver allows for a single PCB design to implement both endpoints and midpoints in our network. Additionally this board is compatible with the Adafruit Feather microcontroller development board format.
